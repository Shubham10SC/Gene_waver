**GeneWeaver** is a comprehensive computational framework designed for **Synthetic Biology**, **XNA Genetic Encryption**, and **Bio-Neural Simulation**. It serves as a bridge between in-silico evolutionary models and wet-lab genetic engineering applications.

## 🚀 Core Capabilities
*   **XNA Genetic Firewall:** Encrypts digital data into non-canonical biological sequences.
*   **Darwin-X Evolution Engine:** Simulates evolutionary escape paths and mutation stability.
*   **Bio-Neural Logic:** Abstracts cellular signaling into computational logic gates.

## 📂 Architecture
The project follows a modular hierarchy:
*   `src/modules/`: Core logic (Evolution AI, XNA Core).
*   `src/utils/`: Visualization and reporting tools.
*   `main.py`: Master deployment script.

## 🛠️ Usage
**Master Deployment:**
\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`

**Interactive Terminal:**
\`\`\`bash
python main_dashboard.py
\`\`\`
